1) cd to Deep-EIoU/Deep-EIoU
        - look at tools/maml_demo.py 
            - check that the following are correct:
                    - args.path (should be the path to the dataset you want to use)
                    - args.experiment_name (should be sportsmot-{dataset_type})
                    - args.fine_tune (enter if you want to use maml as fine tuning)
        - run command (creates predicitons)
                - EX: python tools/maml_demo.py --path 'C:/Users/akayl/Desktop/CS330_MOT/dataset/train' --experiment-name sportsmot-train --fine_tune
        - see YOLOX_Outputs/{experiment_name} for results! Pretty cool video btw 

2) Stay in Deep-EIoU/Deep-EIoU
        - look at ak_make_SCT_folder.py
            - make sure the paths are correct for your system
            - make sure the dataset_type variable is the correct one corresponding to the {dataset_type} in the args.expierment_name in maml.demo.py file you just ran
        - run command (makes SCT folder in CS330_MOT/Deep-EIoU) (SCT folder holds the prediction results.)
                - EX: python ak_make_SCT_folder.py

3) Stay in Deep-EIoU/Deep-EIoU
        - look at tools/sport_interpolation.py
                - make sure the args.dataset_type variable is correct
        - run command (this makes a interpolation folder in CS330_MOT/Deep-EIoU) (this formats the SCT folder in the correct format for TrackEval)
                EX: python tools/sport_interpolation.py 


TrackEval setup: (I did this manually.. sorry :/ )
    a) Navigate to CS330_MOT/TrackEval/data
            - ref folder has all the reference files
                    - make sure the sportsmot-test, sportsmot-train, sportsmot-val folders have the correct videos (update with our new dataset splits..)
                            - They should have the gt folder and seqinfo.ini (no need for the imgs for the videos)
                    - in the seqmaps folder 
                            - make sure the correct .txt files are in there labeled (sportsmot-test.txt, sportsmot-train.txt, sportsmot-val.txt)
            - you can delete contents in the res folder 
   manual setup complete :)


4) cd to CS330_MOT
        - look at ak_util/interpolation_to_res.py
                - set the correct paths and dataset_type
        - run command (puts the predictions in the TrackEval/data/res folder)
                - EX: python ak_util/interpolation_to_res.py  

5) cd to TrackEval
        - look at the evaluate.sh file
                - change to get the correct dataset_type for:
                        - SPLIT_TO_EVAL
                        - SEQMAP_FILE 
        - run command (gets the tracking results!! )
                - EX: python ./scripts/run_mot_challenge.py --BENCHMARK sportsmot --SPLIT_TO_EVAL train --METRICS HOTA CLEAR Identity VACE --USE_PARALLEL False --PRINT_CONFIG True --GT_FOLDER ./data/ref --TRACKERS_FOLDER ./data/res --OUTPUT_FOLDER ./output/ --SEQMAP_FILE ./data/ref/seqmaps/sportsmot-train.txt
        - check the TrackEval/output folder for results 

All done :)
